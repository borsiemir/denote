#+BEGIN_Definition
The /language of set theory/, denoted as \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{Ur}}\), is the first order signature extending [[denote:20230913T161450][\(\mathcal{L}_\in\)]] with:
- An unary predicate symbol \(\text{Ur}\).
- An unary predicate symbol \(\text{Set}\).
Given a structure \(\mathfrak{M} : \textsf{Struc}(\mathcal{L}_{\text{Ur}}_{})\), the elements of \(\text{Ur}^{\mathfrak{M}}\) are called the /urelements/ of \(\mathfrak{M}\) and the elements of \(\text{Set}^{\mathfrak{M}}\) are called the /sets/ of \(\mathfrak{M}\).
