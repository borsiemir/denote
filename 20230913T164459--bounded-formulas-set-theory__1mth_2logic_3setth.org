#+begin_Definition
Let \(\mathcal{L}\) be an extension of \(\mathcal{L}_\in\). We define the set of /bounded formulas/, \(\Delta_0\), as the set given by the following BNF:
\[
\Delta_0 ::= \phi \mid \Delta_0 \wedge \Delta_0 \mid \Delta_0 \vee \Delta_0 \mid \Delta_0 \rightarrow \Delta_0 \mid 
\forall x \in t\mathbin{.} \Delta_0 \mid \exists x \in t \mathbin{.} \Delta_0,
\]
where \(\phi\) is any atomic formula and \(t\) is any term.

In other words, bounded formulas are formulas whose all their [[denote:20230913T172207][quantifiers are bounded]].
